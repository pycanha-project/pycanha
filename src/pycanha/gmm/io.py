"""Geometry import and export, reached through ``model.io``.

The accessor form (``tm.gmm.io.read_esatan_erg(path)``) keeps every exchange
format on one object instead of scattering free functions across the package,
and leaves room for the other formats to join it without changing how a caller
reaches them.

The readers are bound as *modules* rather than as the functions they export,
and they import the geometry types from the modules that define them rather
than from ``pycanha.gmm``.  Both are deliberate: the model class is what pulls
this module in, so a reader that reached back for a name at import time would
close a cycle whenever a reader package happened to be imported first.  Binding
the module defers the lookup to the call, by which point everything exists.
