"""Interpret an ESATAN statement stream into a :class:`~pycanha.gmm.GeometryModel`.

The interpretation is a single forward pass with a symbol table, because the
language itself is sequential: a name must be declared before it is assigned,
and a shell must exist before it is combined or cut.

Everything the format can express that pycanha cannot is *dropped with a
diagnostic* rather than guessed at or silently approximated; the diagnostics
carry stable codes so a caller can tell an expected reduction from a surprise.

Three behaviours of the format are not obvious from a file alone and are worth
stating outright, because getting any of them backwards silently misplaces
geometry rather than raising:

* ``ROTATE`` applies three rotations about the **fixed** global axes in the
  order X, Y, Z, and composes with whatever transformation the object already
  carries -- so a rotation after a translation rotates that translation too.
* ``clear = TRUE`` discards the accumulated transformation **entirely**,
  translation included, before applying the new rotation.
* Within a surface, faces run with **parametric direction 1 varying fastest**,
  which is the order both ESATAN and STEP-TAS use, so ``nbase`` and ``ndelta``
  land on the same faces here as they do in the source.
