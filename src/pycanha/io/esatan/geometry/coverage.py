"""What the reader does with every ESATAN geometry construct.

This is the inventory behind the coverage table in the documentation, which is
regenerated from here on every docs build rather than kept as a checked-in file
that could quietly fall behind the code.

Only two things here are written by hand: the list of constructs, and a note
explaining each one.  **The disposition is derived** from the reader's own
mapping tables in :mod:`.mappings`, so a primitive that gains an implementation
changes its row by being implemented, not by anyone remembering to say so.
:mod:`tests.io.esatan.test_erg_coverage_table` fails if the two ever disagree.
